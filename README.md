My LeetCode problem solving journey in Python3

# LeetCode Practice

This is my personal LeetCode practice log. I'm solving problems using **Python** to strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms for technical interviews.

## Structure

- `easy/`: Easy-level problems
- `medium/`: Medium-level problems
- `hard/`: Hard-level problems
- `notes/`: Summary of algorithm patterns

## Progress

| #   | Title   | Difficulty | Link                                           | Language |
| --- | ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | Two Sum | Easy       | [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Python   |

## Goals

- [x] Understand common algorithmic patterns
- [ ] Solve 100+ LeetCode problems
- [ ] Build confidence for technical interviews
